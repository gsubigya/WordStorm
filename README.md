## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Base Words Input**  
   You manually define a list of base words in the script: names, nicknames, birthdays, email handles, etc.

2. **Numbers & Symbols**  
   Add common or target-specific numbers and special characters to enhance combinations.

3. **Smart Combinations**  
   The script generates combinations like:
   - `base + number` â†’ john123
   - `symbol + base` â†’ @john
   - `base + symbol + number` â†’ john@007
   - Variants with capitalizations

4. **Output**  
   The final wordlist is written to a `.txt` file containing potentially **millions** of custom combinations.
